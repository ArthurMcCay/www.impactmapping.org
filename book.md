<p>
Software is everywhere today, but countless software products and
projects die a slow death without ever making any impact. The result
is a tremendous amount of time and money wasted due to wrong
assumptions, lack of focus, poor communication of objectives, lack of
understanding and misalignment with overall goals. There has to be a
better way to deliver!
</p>
<p>
This handbook is a practical guide to impact mapping, a simple yet
incredibly effective method for collaborative strategic planning that
helps organisations make an impact with software. Impact mapping helps
to create better plans and roadmaps that ensure alignment of business
and delivery, and are easily adaptable to change. Impact mapping fits
nicely into several current trends in software product management and
release planning, including goal-oriented requirements engineering,
frequent iterative delivery, agile and lean software methods, lean
startup product development cycles, and design thinking.

<h3>Who is this book for?</h3>
<p>The primary audience of this book are senior people involved in building 
software products or delivering software projects, from both business and 
delivery sides. This includes business sponsors and those whose 
responsibilities include product ownership, project oversight or portfolio 
management, architecture, business analysis, quality improvement and 
assurance and delivery. My experience is mostly with iterative delivery, so I 
write from that perspective, and you'll get most out of these ideas if you work 
in a similar environment.
</p><ul>
<li>
 Business people assigned to software projects will learn how to communicate their ideas better.
</li><li> Senior product or project sponsors will learn how to communicate 
their assumptions more effectively to delivery teams, how to engage delivery 
teams to make better strategic decisions, and how to manage their project 
portfolio more effectively.
</li><li>Delivery teams that are already working under the umbrella of agile or 
lean delivery methods, and more recently lean startup ideas, will learn how to 
better focus deliverables and engage business sponsors and users.
</li><li>Delivery teams moving to agile or lean delivery methods will get ideas 
on how to address some common issues with scaling these practices, such as 
creating a big picture view, splitting work into small chunks that still have 
business value and reporting progress more meaningfully.
