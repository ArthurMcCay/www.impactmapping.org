        <p>Impact mapping is a variant of the InUse effect mapping method,
        introduced by Mijo Balic and Ingrid Domingues (Ottersten), combined
        with impact maps for training organisations invented by Robert O.
        Brinkerhoff, the feature injection ideas of Chris Matts, the
        measurability and iterative delivery ideas of Tom Gilb. It draws
        heavily on their work â€“ enough to say that all key good ideas are
        theirs, I've just linked them together and put them into the
        perspective of modern software delivery practices. You will find
        references to the original ideas at the end of this booklet. Most of
        the glue between these ideas comes from inspiring, insightful and
        challenging conversations I've had with Craig Larman, Tom and Mary
        Poppendieck, Dan North, Gordon Weir, Jeff Patton and Matthias Edinger
        (in no particular order).</p>
        <p>By combining these ideas, impact mapping brings usability and speed
        to proven product and project management strategies, helping them fit
        better into modern software delivery constraints, and at the same time
        applying some great ideas from other industries to software
        delivery.</p>
        <p>This book describes the way I use impact maps. In my previous work,
        I referred to the method described here as "effect mapping", as the
        structure closely resembles InUse effect maps. However, the way I use
        the maps is significantly different from the InUse method. I follow an
        approach much closer to what Brinkerhoff describes in his HET
        (highly-effective training) method, as roadmaps and iteratively refined
        milestone plans. In addition, I found that a slightly modified set of
        questions fits better the kinds of projects that I am involved in.
        InUse effect maps aim to facilitate innovative product design and user
        experience design. As a consultant, I work with ambitious organisations
        to help them improve delivery practices, and they often suffer from
        scope creep, lack of big picture, lack of alignment of delivery teams
        with business objectives; they waste a lot of time and effort building
        the wrong software. Impact mapping is a fantastic way to reduce all
        that suffering. </p>
        <p>Using the same name for both InUse effect maps and the maps as I use
        them caused confusion, to the point that a well-known consultant said
        to one of my clients, "Gojko got effect maps completely wrong, but
        he's on to something". After several conference presentations in
        Sweden, the home of InUse, attendees came to complain that I was
        presenting effect mapping wrongly. This is why in this book, and from
        now on, I will use the name impact maps instead of effect maps for my
        method. By using a different name, I hope to prevent further
        confusion.</p>
        <p>Craig Larman suggested the name "impact maps", which is similar
        enough to effect maps but different enough not to cause confusion.
        Brinkerhoff calls his planning visualisation impact maps, which
        justifies the use of that name. His maps are used for managing training
        plans for organisations, so I hope that there is not much danger of
        confusion.</p>
        <p>Disconnecting the maps I describe here from InUse effect mapping by
        name also allows me to focus completely on managing scope for software
        delivery, and use names for map elements that are more appropriate for
        that context. </p>
