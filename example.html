The map illustrates a milestone of an online gaming platform. The key business goal for this milestone is to increase the number of active players to 1 million.
</p><p>Players are important actors. They can help by recommending games to their friends, posting about the games on Facebook or inviting friends directly.
</p><p>Another group of important actors are advertisers. They can also bring players by publishing adverts.
</p><p>There are several deliverables that can impact player behaviour. For example, semi-automated invites can help make invitations more straightforward, a more personalised experience will make it more likely that players will invite friends, and reaching new levels or achievements should motivate players to post about the games on social networks.
